This repository explains the setup of videodac.eth.link using ENS and IPFS, to direct a user to [videoDAC project homepage](https://explorer.livepeer.org/accounts/0xdac817294c0c87ca4fa1895ef4b972eade99f2fd/campaign).

1. Create `redirect.html`

2. Publish and Pin `redirect.html` to IPFS

Make sure IPFS is running on your localhost.

```
ipfs add redirect.html
```

This will output an IPFS hash, which will look something like this: `QmVFFimGCqqTrkeunZcz65UXXTNHx5hqjGzwzSMkvoCv7p`

```
ipfs pin add QmVFFimGCqqTrkeunZcz65UXXTNHx5hqjGzwzSMkvoCv7p
```

Note: please replace the IPFS hash with the hash generated above.

3. Register the IPFS Hash in ENS

- Go to https://app.ens.domains/

- Click "My Names"

- Create a new "Content" "Record" as below
